This is originally forked from sayrer's JSON sync.  See http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2008/02/15/restful-partial-updates/ for more information.  I have modified it to remove the dependency on MochiKit and also made it a CommonJS loadable module.  Additionally, the tests have been modified to be run using [Expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso).  I have also stripped out the reconciler from the original json-sync, mostly because I didn't need it for my use case and it had a bunch of MochiKit dependencies.
